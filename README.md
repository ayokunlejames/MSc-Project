This research project presents the design and optimization of a scalable national product information
management (PIM) system tailored for the National Health Service (NHS) in the United
Kingdom. The research aims to address existing challenges in product information management
within the NHS supply chain and procurement ecosystem by improving data access, quality, and
interoperability. Guided by specific research objectives, the study conducts a comprehensive
analysis of existing PIM practices, identifies key challenges, and assesses stakeholder needs and
requirements.

The research follows the information system development lifecycle, encompassing requirements
analysis, system design, implementation, and evaluation. Leveraging advanced relational
database management technologies, the developed PIM system offers enhanced scalability,
optimization, and usability in a real-world NHS setting. The system architecture adopts a 3-tier
client-server model, integrating a MySQL database managed through the Aiven platform and a
Streamlit application for user interaction.

Through user testing and performance monitoring, the developed PIM system demonstrates
promising functionality, performance, and usability. Key findings highlight the system's potential
to improve supply chain efficiency, product data management, and patient safety within the
NHS.

Overall, this study contributes to advancing healthcare product management practices within the
NHS, laying the groundwork for improved data management, interoperability, and patient care
delivery. The developed PIM system offers a scalable and optimized solution tailored to the
unique needs of the UK healthcare system, with implications for healthcare systems worldwide.
